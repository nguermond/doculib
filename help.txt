****** Libraries ******

• Each library points to a unique directory. Each library must 
  have a unique document type, which indicates:
	> Whether to keep track of DOI or ISBN book
	> The default database to search for metadata
• Libraries can be managed by selecting the 'Library' menu:
	> A library may be renamed by selecting the name field
	> Removing a library will never remove the physical files in 
	the library. If 'Delete metadata' is selected, the metadata 
	will be removed, but not the files
	> A new library may be created by selecting an existing 
	directory. All files in that directory are automatically 
	added to that library
• Selected files may be moved between libraries by dragging them 
  to a library tab
• Libraries may be rearranged by dragging tabs

****** Entries ******

• Right click on an entry for the following options:
	> Open -- opens the file
	> Search Metadata -- Search for metadata on either 
	openlibrary.org (for books) or semanticscholar.org 
	(for articles). The default search query is either the 
	title (if nonempty) or the name of the file. It typically 
	works best to use the full title as search query, 
	without authors, date, etc.
	> Open DOI -- if the file has a DOI, open the doi address 
	in a web browser
	> Copy BibTex -- if the file has a DOI, search for the BibTex 
	entry at crossref.org. Note this is not supported for books
	> Copy File Name -- copy file name to clipboard
	> Copy File Path -- copy absolute file path to clipboard
	> Delete File -- will delete the physical file and metadata 
	in your library
• Left click on an entry's field to edit
• Multiple entries may be selected by holding SHIFT or CONTROL

****** Missing/Duplicate Files ******

• If multiple entries refer to identical files (irrespective of 
  their file names), they will be marked as duplicates
• If an entry refers to a file which is missing, and the file cannot 
  be found, it will be marked as missing. If the missing file 
  is found, the entry will be appropriately remapped
