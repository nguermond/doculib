# Metadb

Metadb is a library to locally store and manipulate a JSON database of file metadata. A key feature of Metadb is that the user may rename or move files within a library, or move files between directories, and Metadb will resolve missing or renamed files according to their MD5 hash. Metadb can also find duplicate files across libraries.

See the [documentation](https://nguermond.github.io/doculib/docs/metadb/index.html) for details.
